The project asks the user which drive they want to create their folder in, asks the name of the directory, and sets permissions for the current user. If the directory name exists, it asks the user if they want to modify the folder's perissions or delete the directory. I added a lot of error and exception handlers to make sure the application does not have any bugs or produce errors.</p>
