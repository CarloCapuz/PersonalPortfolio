		<p class="w3-large w3-hide-small">The reason why I created this blog about Joji is that he greatly inspired me to create a significant transition/change in my life. If he can go from FilthyFrank, posting weird, extreme challenges and rants about stuff on the internet, and Pink Guy, a pink zentai-wearing, acting like a weird squirmy person in public, parody rap making guy, soaring the charts with his rap parody album, to Joji, this brilliant artist who creates music about life, love and heartaches, then I can do the same thing. His achievements and transition inspired me to become a better person than I was in the past and I wear my Hand of God necklace to remind myself to make a change.</p>
